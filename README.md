# rpi-scripts

Simple Bash scripts for the Raspberry Pi.
Make sure that change the constants in the scripts to suit your needs.

* `rpi-sync.sh`: synchronizes the root and boot directories of the RPi using SSH and rsync to a local machine. Convenient for backups.
* `rpi_sd_setup.sh`: flashes a Raspberry Pi image to an SD card.
* `qemu-rpi`: loads a Raspberry Pi QEMU image file.
